# Overview
_In this project, we use SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. We write SQL codes to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database. We run SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output of your queries._

# Introduction
_The Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, we will be querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance._
